#### **Day 2: Success Story**
```
Subject: "Sarah got 47 leads in 24 hours üìà"

Hi [Name],

Did you build your lead research agent yet?

If not, here's motivation: Sarah (marketing agency owner) 
built hers yesterday and woke up to 47 qualified leads.

Her exact words: "This is insane. My VA used to find 
10 leads per day for $150. This found 47 for $2."

The difference? She followed the tutorial exactly and 
set it up before bed.

Tomorrow I'll share the #1 mistake people make 
(and how to avoid it).

#### **Day 3: Common Mistake**
```
Subject: "The $3,000 mistake (avoid this) ‚ö†Ô∏è"

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you built your lead agent yet?

If you're stuck, you might be making the same $3,000 
mistake I see constantly...

Most people try to build the "perfect" system first.
They spend weeks researching tools, comparing options,
and never actually build anything.

Meanwhile, their competitors are getting 100 leads/day
with the "good enough" system from our free tutorial.

Here's the truth: A working 80% solution beats a 
perfect 0% solution every time.

üëâ Build the simple version first: [LINK]

You can always upgrade later (which is exactly what
our Academy teaches).

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### **Day 4: Social Proof**
```
Subject: "127 people built this yesterday üöÄ"

Hi [Name],

Amazing news: 127 people built their lead research 
agent yesterday using our free tutorial!

The results are pouring in:
‚Ä¢ "Got 23 leads in 4 hours" - Mike
‚Ä¢ "Replaced my $2,000/month VA" - Jennifer  
‚Ä¢ "5x'd my pipeline overnight" - David

But here's what's interesting...

The people getting the BEST results aren't just 
building one agent. They're building entire AI 
workforces.

That's exactly what we teach in the full Academy:
12 different agents that work together like a 
virtual team.

Curious? I'll share more tomorrow.

For now, build your first agent: [LINK]

#### **Day 5: The Big Picture**
```
Subject: "Beyond lead research (the full picture) üéØ"

Hi [Name],

By now you've hopefully built your lead research agent
and seen some results.

But here's a question: What happens AFTER you find 
the leads?

Most people manually:
‚Ä¢ Research each company individually
‚Ä¢ Write personalized outreach messages  
‚Ä¢ Follow up multiple times
‚Ä¢ Track responses in spreadsheets
‚Ä¢ Qualify and score prospects

What if ALL of that was automated too?

That's the power of an AI workforce:

Agent 1: Finds leads (you built this)
Agent 2: Researches companies deeply
Agent 3: Writes personalized outreach
Agent 4: Follows up automatically
Agent 5: Qualifies and scores responses
Agent 6: Books meetings in your calendar

Imagine: 100 leads found, researched, contacted, 
and qualified while you sleep.

This is what our Academy students build in 30 days.

#### **Day 6: Objection Handling**
```
Subject: "But I'm not technical... ü§î"

Hi [Name],

"This looks amazing, but I'm not technical at all.
Can someone like me really build AI agents?"

I get this question daily.

Here's the truth: Our most successful students are 
often the LEAST technical.

Why? Because they focus on business results, not 
technical perfection.

Take Janet (real estate agent, age 58):
‚Ä¢ Never used automation before
‚Ä¢ Built 6 agents in 30 days
‚Ä¢ Increased her pipeline by 400%
‚Ä¢ Now teaches other agents in her office

Or Mike (restaurant owner):
‚Ä¢ "I can barely use Excel"
‚Ä¢ Built agents for inventory, staffing, marketing
‚Ä¢ Saved 20 hours/week
‚Ä¢ Opened second location with the time saved

The secret? We teach business workflows, not coding.
Everything is point-and-click, drag-and-drop.

If you can use email, you can build AI agents.

#### **Day 7: Final Call**
```
Subject: "Last chance (doors close tonight) üö™"

Hi [Name],

This is it - enrollment for AI Workforce Academy 
closes tonight at midnight.

I wanted to reach out personally because I believe 
this could change everything for your business.

Here's what happens when you join:

Week 1: Build your content creation agent
Week 2: Add customer service automation  
Week 3: Create sales follow-up sequences
Week 4: Deploy complete AI workforce

By day 30, you'll have agents handling:
‚Ä¢ Lead generation (you already started this)
‚Ä¢ Content creation and social media
‚Ä¢ Customer support and FAQ responses
‚Ä¢ Sales follow-up and appointment booking
‚Ä¢ Data analysis and reporting
‚Ä¢ Administrative tasks and scheduling

Students typically save 20-30 hours per week
and increase revenue by 40-60%.

But enrollment closes tonight.

After that, the next opportunity is in 3 months
(and the price will be higher).
